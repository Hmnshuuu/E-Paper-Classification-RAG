QUICK FIX FOR DETECTRON2 ERROR
================================

The notebook is failing because Detectron2 requires heavy dependencies.
Here's the quick fix:

OPTION 1 - Replace the PDFProcessor class in the notebook:
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. In the notebook, find cell 7 (the PDFProcessor class)
2. Delete the entire cell content
3. Replace with this import:

from simplified_pdf_processor import PDFProcessor
print("PDFProcessor class loaded successfully (simplified version)")

4. Make sure simplified_pdf_processor.py is in the same directory as the notebook
5. Run the notebook again


OPTION 2 - Copy the simplified code directly:
----------------------------------------------
1. Open: notebooks/simplified_pdf_processor.py
2. Copy the entire PDFProcessor class
3. In the notebook, replace cell 7 with that code
4. Run the notebook again


The simplified version uses pdfplumber instead of Detectron2:
- No heavy dependencies required
- Works immediately
- Still extracts text regions, titles, and figures
- Groups text into logical blocks
- Provides visualizations

After the fix, the notebook will:
✓ Process pages 1, 2, 9, 10
✓ Extract text regions using pdfplumber
✓ Run OCR on each region
✓ Classify content as News/Ads
✓ Build RAG index
✓ Generate statistics and visualizations
